## FrontEnd technologies
### LayUI
layUI is a front-end UI framework written in its own module specification, following the writing and organization of native HTML/CSS/JS. This project uses the background framework provided by LayUI to carry out the back-end architecture of the system, and uses a large number of LayUI components, such as some small icons, to improve system functions and beautify the interface.
### Bootstarp
The system uses the HTML and CSS specifications provided by Bootstrap to optimize the front-end interface. The responsive layout used to make the system compatible with multiple terminals provides users with a better interface and user experience. At the same time, this system also uses jQuery, Bootstrap's built-in jQuery plug-in can be used together to facilitate development.
### jQuery+jQueryUI
This system uses the Javascript script library in jQuery, and uses the function functions provided by jQuery to complete the coding logic, realize the business functions, and solve the compatibility problems of multiple browsers.
This system uses a lot of plug-ins in jQuery UI and animation effects, such as calendars for selecting dates in the system, statistically generated charts, and so on. At the same time it is free and open source, can be customized or even redesigned according to needs, very convenient and easy to use.
## Backend Technologies
### JSP
JSP has a static part and a dynamic part, in which Java scripts can be embedded. This system mainly uses JSTL's iteration tag <c:forEach>, combined with the EL expression ${}, iteratively outputs the content inside the tag, simplifying the iterative operation
### MyBatis
MyBatis is an open source framework that implements the JPA specification to connect to a database and add, delete, modify, and check it. The underlying is a JDBC-encapsulated component.
This system mainly uses Mybatis-Generator, a plug-in that automatically generates entity code. It can easily generate entity class, Mapper interface and corresponding XML file.
### Spring
Spring is an open source framework. One of its main advantages is its layered architecture, which allows users to choose which component to use and provides an integrated framework for J2EE application development. Spring uses basic JavaBeans to do things that were previously only possible with EJBs. The core of Spring is Control Inversion (IoC) and Aspect Orientation (AOP).
### SpringMVC
The Spring MVC framework provides a DispatcherServlet as a front-end controller to dispatch requests, while providing flexible configuration handler mapping, view resolution, locale and topic resolution, and file upload support. Each function implementation is handled by a dedicated object. Spring MVC also separates the roles of controllers, model objects, dispatchers, and handler objects.
### Maven
The Maven repository is used to store all the Jar packages managed by Maven, divided into local warehouses and central warehouses. A project in Maven is represented by a unique coordinate. In the development of this project, it needs to rely on other projects, so PO should have the dependency attribute to represent the external project it depends on, and pom.xml is the XML description of the PO object.
